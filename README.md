# terraform-aws-identity-center-users

[![Release][release-badge]][latest-release]

üí° Learn more about Masterpoint [below](#who-we-are-ê¶Çñ®ÜêÄ™ñ†ã).

## Purpose and Functionality

This Terraform module provisions, configures, and manages AWS IAM Identity Center (SSO) with built-in user provisioning, including assigning users, groups, and permission sets.

- This is designed to be seamless for organizations that want to **manage users within the AWS Identity Center directory as their identity source** instead of an external identity provider (such as Okta, Azure Active Directory, etc.). This means that all users are managed by IaC.

### Notes

- Authentication is handled by AWS Identity Center. Upon user creation by TF, the user will be in AWS Identity Center directory.
  - However, the AWS Terraform provider does not support the setting the option to send credentials/verification email after creation, so the administrator must go into the AWS Identity Center directory console and and enable ["Send email OTP for users created from API"](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/userswithoutpwd.html), or manually request to send a verification email per each user so users can reset their own password.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

- You will need to manually (ClickOps) enable AWS Identity Center & create an SSO instance in the AWS account that you want to be set as the "management account" for your organization. See https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/enable-identity-center.html.
  - The SSO instance itself is not managed by Terraform, there is no Terraform resource for it. Settings like MFA configurations must be updated on the AWS console ClickOps.
- After enabling, Terraform can reference it using the `data "aws_ssoadmin_instances" "sso" {}` data source.

### See below for a simplistic example of how to use this module

```hcl
data "aws_ssoadmin_instances" "sso" {}

locals {
  instance_arn      = tolist(data.aws_ssoadmin_instances.sso.arns)[0]
  identity_store_id = tolist(data.aws_ssoadmin_instances.sso.identity_store_ids)[0]
}

module "aws_sso" {
  source = "github.com/masterpointio/terraform-aws-identity-center-users?ref=v1.x.x"

  instance_arn      = local.instance_arn
  identity_store_id = local.identity_store_id

  users = [
    {
      user_name   = "john.doe"
      given_name  = "John"
      family_name = "Doe"
      email       = "john.doe@example.com"
    },
  ]

  groups = [
    {
      name        = "Administrators"
      description = "Full administrative access"
      members     = ["john.doe"]
      assignments = [
        {
          permission_set = "AdministratorAccess"
          account_ids    = ["123456789012", "234567890123"]
        }
      ]
    },
  ]

  permission_sets = [
    {
      name             = "AdministratorAccess"
      description      = "Full administrator access to an account."
      session_duration = "PT12H"
      managed_policies = [
        "arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AdministratorAccess"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Examples

Here are some examples of using this module:

- [`examples/complete`](./examples/complete) - example using a `tfvars` file to manage users, groups, and permission sets
- [`examples/json-user-management`](./examples/json-user-management) - example using a `json` file to manage users, groups, and permission sets
- [`examples/yaml-user-management`](./examples/yaml-user-management) - example using a `yaml` file to manage users, groups, and permission sets
